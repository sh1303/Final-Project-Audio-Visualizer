<h1>Final Project Check-In — Music Visualizer (OpenGL + C++)</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Project Description</h2>

    <p>
        For our final project, <strong>Nirshal Chandra Sekar</strong> and <strong>Samra Huseynova</strong> 
        are going to implement a real-time 3D music visualizer using only OpenGL and C++. 
        The goal is to create a dynamic visual scene that responds to audio in real time through 
        movements of different shapes, color changes, lighting variations, and if time allows, 
        we plan the inclusion of particle effects too.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system will read an audio file, extract raw samples, compute the frequency spectrum 
        using an FFT implementation, and map different frequency bands to visual elements. 
        The main visual components will include a set of 2D/3D bars (or other shapes) whose 
        heights and colors correspond to frequency magnitudes, along with a reactive particle 
        system where emission rate, velocity, and color shift are tied to beat intensity. 
        Adjusting camera pose and adding basic lighting will enhance the overall look, making 
        the visualization feel alive and energetic.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project includes substantial graphics programming (real-time geometry updates, shaders, 
        transformations, lighting, buffer management) and is going to produce a final output that 
        will be different from our previous assignments.

    <h2>Progress Plan / Update</h2>

    <h3>Milestones before December 8</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement WAV file loading and extract amplitude samples.</li>
        <li>Implement FFT routine.</li>
        <li>Map FFT output to a set of frequency bins.</li>
        <li>Build the initial bar visualizer (dynamic heights, simple colors).</li>
        <li>Set up OpenGL window, camera, shaders, VBO/VAO, and basic rendering loop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Week Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement the particle system (spawning on beats, velocity, lifetime, fade).</li>
        <li>Add 3D mode with lighting and materials.</li>
        <li>Add camera orbit/animation and smoother visual transitions.</li>
        <li>Polish the entire system: color themes, smoothing audio data, performance tuning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Biggest Concerns / Unknowns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing FFT efficiently.</li>
        <li>Ensuring smooth real-time performance when many particles are active.</li>
        <li>Synchronizing audio sample processing with visual frame updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Progress So Far</h3>
    <p>
        We started by having a look at some existing cool works for audio visualization. Based on the 
        insights obtained, we have sketched the steps to complete our project. As the initial step, 
        we started with the analysis of audio files. As the next step, we plan to move on to the 
        implementation of FFT.

    <h2>Expected Result</h2>

    <p>
        The final visualizer will display a set of animated bars arranged either in a line or circular 
        pattern. These bars will scale up and down based on the magnitude of the corresponding audio 
        frequencies. Particles will burst outward during strong beats, gradually fading as they move. 
        The scene will use dynamic lighting, color shifts, and a moving camera to create an immersive 
        experience.

    <p>
        Overall, the final project will look like an energized, music-responsive environment with 
        pulsing bars, glowing particle effects, and smooth motion throughout.

        <em>*The addition of particle effects is tentative and depends on workload.</em>
